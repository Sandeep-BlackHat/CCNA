## MPLS
**Multi Protocol ***Label*** System**

- When we connect different connections in our network (Like Company Network for example), and we connect all the **Main Office** and shops
  to it and **Data Centers**, we use ~~switches~~ routers at the end of every node (i.e one System) at end the ~~switch~~ routers is used to connect to other system
  network. Now when they are connected to **cloud** the **Main Network and Traffic Handler**, ~~switches~~ routers are used!
  
- The Routers at the systems or offices are called **CE Routers** and the routers at the cloud are called **PE Routers**!!
